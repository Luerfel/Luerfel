I am currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at PUC Campinas. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed strong skills in languages like C and Python, and have created several projects, including games, robotics, and AI systems. Additionally, I participated in the IoTLab at PUC Campinas, where I honed my skills in IoT, AI, embedded systems, and robotics.
